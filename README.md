# Crypto-Currency-Exchange-Calculator

This is my first ever Python project. 

For this project I created a Crypto Currency Exchange Calculator which does three things. The first thing it does is pulls the most current price from the CoinMarketCap's API and updates every 60 seconds. The second thing is does it uses the price pulled from the API to find out how much Crypto currency you will recieve for a user entered USD amount. The last thing is it uses the price pulled from the API to calulate how much USD you will recieve for a certain amount of Crypto Currency.

For this program I created a similar interface for the user to input all these numbers in the terminal. The user can pick between 6 different Crypto Currencies and can enter their own USD and Crypto amount.
